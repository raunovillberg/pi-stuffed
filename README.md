| [`status-line-timed.ts`](extensions/status-line-timed.ts) | A tiny extension of the original [status-line](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono/blob/main/packages/coding-agent/examples/extensions/status-line.ts) that adds timestamps to the status bar. Shows when each turn completed (e.g., "09:36:42 ✓ Turn 23 complete") so you know exactly when you left off. Timestamps are static and don't auto-refresh. |
